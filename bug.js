This error typically occurs when you're using an older version of Expo CLI or have conflicting dependencies in your project.  It often manifests as a cryptic error message during the build process or when trying to run your app on a simulator or device.  The core issue is that Expo is unable to properly resolve and integrate required native modules for features your app uses (like camera access, location services, or certain UI components).
