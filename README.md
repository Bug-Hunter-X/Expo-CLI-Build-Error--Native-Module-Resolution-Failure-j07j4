# Expo CLI Build Error: Native Module Resolution Failure

This repository demonstrates a common Expo CLI build error related to native module resolution. The error usually manifests as a cryptic message during the build process or when attempting to run the application. The root cause often stems from outdated Expo CLI versions or dependency conflicts.

## Bug Description

The application fails to build, producing an error message that indicates the Expo CLI cannot resolve native modules. These modules are essential for accessing device features (camera, location, etc.). The error message is often unhelpful, making debugging challenging.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file shows a simplified project structure illustrating the scenario where the error occurs.  The exact error message will vary depending on your project's dependencies and Expo version.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the solution: upgrading Expo CLI and dependencies, resolving dependency conflicts, and potentially cleaning the project's cache.

## How to Fix

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you are running the latest version of Expo CLI using `expo upgrade`. 
2. **Check Package.json:** Look for dependency conflicts or outdated packages. Use `npm install` or `yarn install` to update your dependencies and resolve conflicts.
3. **Clean the Cache:**  Try cleaning your Expo cache with `expo start --clear`. 
4. **Check for conflicting native modules:** If you're using multiple libraries which might rely on the same native module versions, check their package.json for any conflicts.  Consider using `npm ls` or `yarn why` to trace dependency trees and ensure there is no redundancy. 
5. **Check your environment:** Ensure your development environment (Node version, Xcode, Android Studio) meets the minimum requirements for the Expo SDK version you're using.  Consult the Expo documentation for more details.
6. **Verify app.json:** Check for any errors in your `app.json` file as an incorrect configuration might trigger native module issues.
