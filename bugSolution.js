The solution involves updating the Expo CLI and resolving any dependency conflicts.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js (Illustrative Solution)
// ... project setup ...

expo upgrade // upgrade expo cli to the latest version
npm install // Install the latest versions of the dependencies
expo start --clear // clear the cache and start the project again
```

Additionally, carefully review your `package.json` for any conflicts or outdated packages. Using `npm ls` or `yarn why` can help identify and resolve these issues.  If the problem persists, you might need to investigate specific native modules used by your app and ensure their compatibility with your setup.
